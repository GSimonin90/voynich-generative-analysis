# A Computational Framework for Decoding the Voynich Manuscript

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)

This repository contains the full codebase, data, and publications for a multi-phase research project into the Voynich Manuscript's language. The research first establishes the artificial nature of the script and then proceeds to decipher its underlying conceptual system, demonstrating a unified logic based on medieval astrology and the doctrine of signatures.

## Research Papers

This project has resulted in two publications which build upon each other and should be read in sequence.

### Paper 1: Experimental Verification of the Voynich Manuscript's Artificial Language Hypothesis
* **Description:** This foundational paper uses a generative LSTM model to prove that the manuscript's language is artificial and rule-based, paving the way for further analysis.
* **Publication:** Zenodo. [![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.5281/zenodo.17345194-blue)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17345194)

### Paper 2: From Grammar to Meaning: A Computational and Historical Framework for Decoding the Voynich Manuscript
* **Description:** This second paper builds upon the first discovery, reverse-engineering the manuscript's grammar, decoding its conceptual system by linking it to medieval astrological frameworks, and unifying the logic of the zodiacal and botanical sections.
* **Publication:** Zenodo. [![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.5281/zenodo.17360252-blue)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17360252)

## Repository Structure

* `/scripts/`: Contains all Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for the analyses in both papers.
* `/data/`: Contains the original and cleaned Voynich transcriptions.
* `/lexicon/`: Contains the generated morpheme dictionaries (`roots.txt`, etc.).
* `/rules/`: Contains the generated grammatical rule files.
* `/sections/`: Contains the manuscript text segmented by thematic section.
* `/charts/`: Contains all charts and visualizations generated by the scripts.

## How to Replicate the Experiments

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/GSimonin90/voynich-generative-analysis.git](https://github.com/GSimonin90/voynich-generative-analysis.git)
    cd voynich-generative-analysis
    ```
2.  **Set Up the Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Explore the Scripts:** All analysis scripts are located in the `/scripts/` directory. Each script is self-contained and documented.
